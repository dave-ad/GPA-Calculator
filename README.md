Tasks including declaring string and numeric variables, assigning and extracting values, and performing calculations are routine, but essential. Equally important, task of communicating results to the application user.

OBJECTIVES
-Work on variables to store and retrive data.
-Perform basic math operations.
-Format strings to present results.


SUMMARY
My goal was to build an application that takes course information for a student, calculates the overall GPA, and displays the results.

To accomplish this, I declared and assigned values to variables of different data types, performed numeric operations, and used type casting to achieve accurate results. You also used the WriteLine() method and character escape sequences to format the output.
